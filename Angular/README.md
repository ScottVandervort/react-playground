# What is this?

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.4. 

It is a showcase of basic functionality that is required acorss all client applications.

# What I am working on ....

## SimpleAJAX

When running ng-serve you DON'T have a backing server to which you can make AJAX requests - everything needs to be mocked up. 

As I want to hit an actual service I created a very simple CORS-enabled service which I intend to call with the Angualar Http Module.

# Urls



# Using the Angualr CLI ( boilerplate comments from project generation 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
