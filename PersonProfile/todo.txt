To Do 
-----

    1. Get working.

    2. Style it.

    3. Implement Redux.

    4. Implement update.

    5. Implement Typescript.



Day One
-------
- Created project using React Starter : https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
- Got basic layout working with Css-Grid

Day Two
-------
- Got Routing working as well as placeholders for React Components.

Day Three
---------
- Started using Css-Grid but migrated to Bootstrap 3. Why? React-Bootstrap only supports Bootstrap 3 - and I would like to use it's gylp library and MIGHT want to use it's widgets.
- Added a GruntFile to copy resources over from node_modules - but decided to just pull from CDN's for now for ease and performance reasons.
- Moved Css to css folder.
