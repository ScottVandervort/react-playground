Terms

    Responsive Design - designing layout to be responsive to different dimensions.

    Mobile First - designing layout for mobile dimensions first and then progressively enhancing it for larger dimensions.

    Grid layout ( Bootstrap )

    Box Model ( versus Flexbox) ( versus Css Grid )



Day One
-------
- Created project using React Starter : https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app
- Got basic layout working with Css-Grid

Day Two
-------
- Got Routing working as well as placeholders for React Components.

Day Three
---------
- Started using Css-Grid but migrated to Bootstrap 3. Why? React-Bootstrap only supports Bootstrap 3 - and I would like to use it's gylp library and MIGHT want to use it's widgets.
- Added a GruntFile to copy resources over from node_modules - but decided to just pull from CDN's for now for ease and performance reasons.
- Moved Css to css folder.

Day Four
--------
- Started using Bootstrap 4 : https://reactstrap.github.io/
- Still working on layout - but finally got responsive design working.

    FYI: col-4 ~ doesn't mean START at column 4; it means take up 4 columns. So, it's location in the grid layout is dependent on it's predecessor.

    My layout looks like this :

        [           ][   Header   ]
        [    Nav    ][  Content   ]
        [         Footer          ]

        [][ Header ]
        [    Nav   ]
        [   Body   ]
        [  Footer  ]
