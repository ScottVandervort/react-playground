Glossary
==============================	
Component Based Architecture ( CBA )
Imperative versus Declarative Programming

	
What is It
===============================		

Re-reusable self-contained components.

Mangaes how views change in response to data ( state ) changes.

Maintains a virtual DOM for performance; Only updates what is needed.

Does not require a headless browser for testing dur to its vDOM.

Declarative over imperative. Less coding.

Only one-way binding

Angular is 2-way binding.

Better than Angular because have more control over updates - Angular DOM updates can spread out of control as 
view updates data updates view etc...

Eliminates confusing template syntax and replaces with Javascript

React Stack needs Router and Redux - otheriwse just a View / template layer.

JSX = COffeescript.
